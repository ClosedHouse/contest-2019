This is a solution for fixing the grep.feature test.
----------------------------------------------------

Solution: "grep -h" prints the output to the stderr, not stdout as it is expected in the Scenario. To fix that you have to:
 - in grep.feature replace stdout with stderr in the respective step
 - in steps/generic.py implement new step for testing the stderr. You can simply copy the step checking the stdout and replace stdout with stderr in the copy.
