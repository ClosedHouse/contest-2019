Introduction:

Behave (https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is the Python implementation of the Behavior-driven development method. You can use it to implement tests writen in a human language (co called Gherkin language).
Test scenarios are implemented using steps that may look as follows:

	Scenario: file -v prints the program version
                Given I Install package "file"
		 When I run command "file -v"
		 Then command exit code is "0"
		  And command stdout contains string "file-5."
		  And command stdout contains string "magic file from /etc/magic:/usr/share/misc/magic"

Of course you need to implement those steps in Python first so that you can use them. 
The benefit of this approach is that once you have the basic steps implemented, you can 
combine them in new test scenarios. Even another person may do that without knowing 
coding in Python, he/she would just describe the test scenario in a human language.

You can get more information on the project page and in the tutorial

Before you start:
 - ensure that python3-behave package is intalled, i.e. run
   '# dnf -y install python3-behave'
 - verify that behave works as expected, i.e. run 
   '# behave file.feature'
   to run the file.feature scenario.. it should pass.


Task description:
Finish the implementation of the test scenario in grep.feature file. At the same time do not
break with your changes already working scenario file.feature. I.e.

 1. '# behave file.feature' works
 2. '# behave grep.feature' works

Individual steps are implemented in steps/generic.py.
