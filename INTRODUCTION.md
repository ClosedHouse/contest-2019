##Introduction

We are **BaseOS QE** team, which is taking care of RHEL's (Red Hat Enterprise Linux) quality as it's main responsibility. So, we test RHEL, but that doesn't mean we just cluelessly push buttons in the GUI :) We use a lot of different tools for testing (Bash, Python and testing frameworks written in those languages, automation, static code analyzers, etc.), we work in terminal most of the time, automate a lot and have to deal with a huge spectre of technology.

In this game you have a chance to try some of those. You'll look for security exploits, write tests in Python testing framework - Behave, and look for errors in an RPM package with internal testing framework BeakerLib.

The game is composed of 3 levels. In each level you have to get a secret code that should match pattern **OH19\_[A-Z1-9]**. As soon as you get the secret code, level is considered done and you can choose a gift for yourself :)
